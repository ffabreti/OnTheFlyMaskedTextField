<h1>OnTheFlyMaskedTextField</h1>
<p>This Titanium Alloy project demonstrate the use of masks on TextFields.</p>
<p>The code is basically composed of two parts:</p>
<ul> <li> The String.prototype function </li>
<li> The TextField's Callbacks </li>
</ul>

<h1>Options</h1>
<p> Right now, you'd better use it with numeric masks, it still doesn't support use of letters very well </p>

<h1> Usage </h1>
<p> I wish I could know how to extend Titanium objects to enable TextFields to use the new functionality. If you know how to do it, please fork and make a pull request!</p>
</p>
<p>
Import the project into TiStudio via File > Import and give it a try.

Mask examples:
<ul> <li> +99 (999) 999 99999 </li>
<li> 99.999.999/9999-99 </li>
</ul>
